# name = 'Bob'
# save_name = name
# name.upcase!
# puts name, save_name

=begin
On line one the string Bob is assigned to the variable name
online 2 save_name is assigned to the variable name and at this time save_name is Bob
on line 3 name is upcased witha ! this means that the string 'Bob' is mutated and
reasigns name to a new variable 'BOB' and save_name to BOB.
so the result should be BOB BOB.
